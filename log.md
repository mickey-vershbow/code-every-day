# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day 1 of Kevin Powell's 21-day Responsive Design course, completed a 1.5 hour Javascript assessment (sample assessment on Hired platform)

**Thoughts:** I got two questions on the javascript assessment:
1. Write an equation that finds the largest integer in a 'numbers' array.
2. Compare the sum total of the left side and right side of a binary tree to find which side is larger.

I had absolutely no idea how to approach the second question, as I haven't learned data structures yet, so I need to get on that. I was able to figure out a good solution for the second question but it took me almost an hour!

### Day 2: August 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed two codewars challenges and day two of Kevin Powell's responsive layouts course.

**Thoughts:** I was able to complete the codewars challenges using for loops, but need to work on more DRY solutions using reduce, filter, forEach

### Day 3: August 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress:**  One hour of studying Data Structures via GA module, one hour of Javascript practice, one hour of job searching. Completed day 3 of Kevin Powell course.
