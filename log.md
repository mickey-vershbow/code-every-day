# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day 1 of Kevin Powell's 21-day Responsive Design course, completed a 1.5 hour Javascript assessment (sample assessment on Hired platform)

**Thoughts:** I got two questions on the javascript assessment:

1. Write an equation that finds the largest integer in a 'numbers' array.
2. Compare the sum total of the left side and right side of a binary tree to find which side is larger.

I had absolutely no idea how to approach the second question, as I haven't learned data structures yet, so I need to get on that. I was able to figure out a good solution for the second question but it took me almost an hour!

### Day 2: August 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed two codewars challenges and day two of Kevin Powell's responsive layouts course.

**Thoughts:** I was able to complete the codewars challenges using for loops, but need to work on more DRY solutions using reduce, filter, forEach

### Day 3: August 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Two hours of studying computer science and algorithms via GA module. Completed day 3 of Kevin Powell course.

**Thoughts:** I finally understand the difference between pixels, ems, and rems. CSS is still very very hard. So far I'm following the reading on Big O notation but have had trouble applying concepts with analogies.

### Day 4: August 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day four of Kevin Powell's responsive layout course + one hour of data structures and algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of Big O notation -- also getting better at using ems/rems for styling.

### Day 5: August 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day five of Kevin Powell's responsive layout course + one hour of data structures and algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of Big O notation -- also getting better at using ems/rems for styling.

### Day 6: August 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Job search day!

**Thoughts:** It's gotta happen eventually!

### Day 7: August 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Several hours of studying recursion and writing recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** I understand all the concepts but need a lot more practice. One idea -- take iterative functions and re-write them to use recursion instead.

### Day 8: August 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finally understand how to make a basic responsive layout! Otherwise just Javascript practice all day.

### Day 9: August 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** A few hours working on responsive layouts using flexbox. Job searching / networking. Finally learned about CSS pseudo elements.

### Days 10-17: August 12-19, 2021

**Progress** Deep dive into a full redesign on the capstone project I made in bootcamp: Ruby on Rails backend + React frontend with third-party API integration. Also lots of assessments on job search platforms.

**Thoughts** I need to learn much, much more about CS fundamentals for job interview prep. I'm getting much, much better at responsive layout patterns. I've also been able to research and implement solutions for problems in React with relative ease and speed compared to when i was in bootcamp.

### Days 18-22: August 20-24, 2021

**Progress** Portfolio is DONE for now! No need to put a million projects up, the four that are up there now represent my best work. I think it would be more useful to try and contribute to open-source projects or something like that rather than go and try to make the calculator or the stock prices API i built for class homework look impressive. Otherwise I've just been focused on studying recursion, CS fundamentals, and making my way through Cracking The Code Interview.

**Thoughts** I need to practice walking through and explaining my code. I think i'll start making recordings of myself doing this for practice, and so I can identify aspects of my code that I can't explain or don't understand very well.

### Days 23/24: August 25-26, 2021

**Progress** Learned how to solve the TwoSum algorithm problem, while it would still be difficult for me to just write the code off the top of my head, I mostly understand the solution and why it doesn't work to just use nested loops.

**Thoughts** I need to understand how Map and hashtables work in javascript

### Days 25/26: August 27-28, 2021

**Progress** Solved TwoSum and RemoveDuplicates challenges on leetcode; ReverseStringInPlace on CodeWars; Started studying bubble and insertion sorting algorithms. Learned about computed properties in JS. Still need to learn about Map objects and Memoization patterns.

**Thoughts** Need to spend more time solving challenges on my own, however I can, before studying optimal solutions. Practice writing nested loops and then you can optimize!

### Days 27-33: August 29 - September 4, 2021

**Progress** Learned about linked list, wrote a solution to determine if it has a cycle. Completed several algorithm challenges with Kyle. Conquered CSS Grid and used it to style the forms on AHP to wireframe spec. Networked on Out In Tech, connected with Rhys Ryan of Ekkobar and will begin learning Python next week.

**Thoughts** I'm excited to see how quickly I can learn Python now that I have a better understanding of the basic patterns in all programming languages (variables, data types, getters and setters, functions, conditionals, loops)

### Days 27-35: September 5 - 13, 2021

**Progress** I've been coding every day! At the moment I'm still working on this volunteer project, which mostly involves a ton of styling with CSS grid. I did some work for a startup creating an admin panel using Google Data Studio. Otherwise continuing to study algorithms and data structures. Most recently I solved the Merge Sorted Arrays problem on LeetCode.

### OCTOBER 2nd, 2021

**Progress**
-- I've been building real apps for real people! Flexing my MERN stack muscles and currently working on pagination for an index of cards.
-- Algo and CS practice, today was insertion sort
-- Built a dynamic "traffic light" with React


### OCTOBER 5th, 2021

**Progress**
-- Putting in the reps with OOP. I can now define OOP, describe the four pillars of OOP with real-world examples, and code up class hierarchies and object instances with relative ease.
-- Working on building stuff with some logic to implement. Today I redid the GA Streetfighter Lab. I was able to code up my own version in 1.5 hours, which was huge compared to having a really hard time with every single line back in Bootcamp. Now I could mostly do it on my own but I got stuck at the game logic, of course. The while loop got stuck in an infinite loop. The conditionals were way too repetitive. The toggle didn't quite work. Overall I got the bones of it though, maybe 80%. Then I looked back at how I successfully solved it last time, tweaked mine a bit, and got there. Tomorrow I will build it again and then try Blackjack.
-- Need to also do some actual HackerRank challenges
