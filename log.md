# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day 1 of Kevin Powell's 21-day Responsive Design course, completed a 1.5 hour Javascript assessment (sample assessment on Hired platform)

**Thoughts:** I got two questions on the javascript assessment:

1. Write an equation that finds the largest integer in a 'numbers' array.
2. Compare the sum total of the left side and right side of a binary tree to find which side is larger.

I had absolutely no idea how to approach the second question, as I haven't learned data structures yet, so I need to get on that. I was able to figure out a good solution for the second question but it took me almost an hour!

### Day 2: August 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed two codewars challenges and day two of Kevin Powell's responsive layouts course.

**Thoughts:** I was able to complete the codewars challenges using for loops, but need to work on more DRY solutions using reduce, filter, forEach

### Day 3: August 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Two hours of studying computer science and algorithms via GA module. Completed day 3 of Kevin Powell course.

**Thoughts:** I finally understand the difference between pixels, ems, and rems. CSS is still very very hard. So far I'm following the reading on Big O notation but have had trouble applying concepts with analogies.

### Day 4: August 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day four of Kevin Powell's responsive layout course + one hour of data structures and algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of Big O notation -- also getting better at using ems/rems for styling.

### Day 5: August 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed day five of Kevin Powell's responsive layout course + one hour of data structures and algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of Big O notation -- also getting better at using ems/rems for styling.

### Day 6: August 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Job search day!

**Thoughts:** It's gotta happen eventually!

### Day 7: August 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Several hours of studying recursion and writing recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** I understand all the concepts but need a lot more practice. One idea -- take iterative functions and re-write them to use recursion instead.

### Day 8: August 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finally understand how to make a basic responsive layout! Otherwise just Javascript practice all day.

### Day 9: August 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** A few hours working on responsive layouts using flexbox. Job searching / networking. Finally learned about CSS pseudo elements.

### Days 10-17: August 12-17, 2021

**Progress** Deep dive into a full redesign on the capstone project I made in bootcamp: Ruby on Rails backend + React frontend with third-party API integration. Also lots of assessments on job search platforms.

**Thoughts** I need to learn much, much more about CS fundamentals for job interview prep. I'm getting much, much better at responsive layout patterns. I've also been able to research and implement solutions for problems in React with relative ease and speed compared to when i was in bootcamp.
